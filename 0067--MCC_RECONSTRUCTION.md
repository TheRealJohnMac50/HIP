# Summary
[summary]: #summary

- Many innocent people have been harmed by the MCC’s actions. These actions include but are not limited to banning Deeper and Panther’s maker keys without protecting innocent non gaming hotspot operators. Therefore, the current MCC structure is not viable and must be reconstructed. 

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

 - The motivation and goals of this HIP is to prevent innocent people from being harmed and to keep the Helium Network’s decentralization ideals.

# Stakeholders

 - In reality, this HIP effects everyone, but specifically hotspot operators. 

# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

 - The community recognizes that the MCC are all (self-appointed) volunteers, with the objectives of protecting the Helium Network and keeping it safe.  However, regardless of circumstance, many innocent people have been harmed by the MCC’s actions. These actions include but are not limited to banning Deeper and Panther’s maker keys. The MCC recognizes that (although not their intent) their actions may have harmed innocent people (financially and mentally), but do not see a viable alternative. Therefore, the current MCC structure is not viable and must be reconstructed. 

 - This HIP proposes that the current authority of the MCC be limited, to comply with the Helium Network’s decentralization goals. Specifically, the MCC will no longer have the authority to permanently ban nor ban long-term any entity or entity’s maker key, without the approval vote from the community. However, in order to prevent an entity involved in institutional gaming from onboarding many hotspots prior to the results of the community vote, the MCC will have the authority to temporarily ban maker keys, until the results of the permanent/long term community vote come to pass. The process will be the following, should the MCC find an entity guilty of anything that they deem worthy of a permanent or long-term ban, then the MCC may propose a community vote on said ban. The results of the vote (no matter how few/many people voted) will be the sole final determination on whether (or not) a new potential applicant may join the MCC.

 - Additionally, this HIP proposes that all future new MCC applicants approved by the MCC must be voted on, for the MCC applicant to join the MCC. The results of the vote (no matter how few/many people voted) will be the sole final determination on whether (or not) a new potential applicant may join the MCC. 

 - Finally and most importantly, this HIP proposes that the MCC may not propose a vote to ban an entity’s maker key permanent/long term, without first constructing a viable method for those innocent of any wrong doings, to still be capable of onboarding and continuously operating their hotspots/miners post banning said maker key.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

 - Due to the lack of people voting on recent hips, it theoretically may be possible for ill intended people to out vote others.


# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- How will the MCC construct a viable method for those innocent of any wrong doings to still be capable of onboarding and continuously operating their hotspots. 


# Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

Success will be when there is another maker key ban, without any innocent people getting hurt as a result.
